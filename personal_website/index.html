    <h1>Web-Development</h1>
    <p class="web-dev">
      Web development refers to the process of creating websites <br />
      or web applications that are accessible over the internet. <br />
      It involves varioustasks, including web design, front-end <br />

    <h2>How to jump into web-dev></h2>
    <p class="jump-to">
      To jump into web development, you can follow these steps: 1. Learn the
      basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These are the foundational languages
      of the web. HTML is used for creating the structure of web pages, CSS is
      used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used for adding
      interactivity and functionality. 2. Choose a programming language: In
      addition to JavaScript, you may want to learn a server-side programming
      language such as Python, Ruby, or PHP. These languages are used to handle
      server-side logic, database operations, and dynamic content generation. 3.
      Understand front-end development: Familiarize yourself with front-end
      frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. These tools
      help in building interactive user interfaces and managing complex web
      applications. 4. Learn back-end development: Explore server-side
      frameworks like Express.js (for Node.js), Django (for Python), Ruby on
      Rails (for Ruby), or Laravel (for PHP). These frameworks facilitate the
      development of server-side logic and database connectivity. 5. Get
      hands-on experience: Practice by working on small projects or building
      personal websites. Implement what you've learned to gain practical
      knowledge and problem-solving skills. 6. Expand your knowledge: Stay
      updated with the latest web development trends, frameworks, and tools.
      Explore additional technologies like databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB),
      version control systems (e.g., Git), and deployment platforms (e.g.,
      Heroku, AWS). 7. Join online communities: Engage with the web development
      community through forums, online communities, and social media.
      Participating in discussions, asking questions, and sharing your work can
      help you learn and grow. 8. Build a portfolio: Assemble a portfolio of
      your web development projects to showcase your skills and experience.
      Having a portfolio will be valuable when applying for jobs or freelance
      opportunities. 9. Consider formal education or courses: While not
      necessary, formal education or online courses can provide structured
      learning and guidance. Many platforms offer web development courses, such
      as Udemy, Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, and Codecademy. 10. Practice continuous
      learning: Web development is a constantly evolving field. Stay curious,
      keep learning, and stay updated with new technologies, frameworks, and
      best practices. Remember, web development is a vast field, and it's
      important to focus on specific areas based on your interests and goals.
      Start small, take one step at a time, and gradually expand your skills and
      knowledge.
